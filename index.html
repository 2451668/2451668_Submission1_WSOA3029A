            <h3>Overview of Data Visualisation</h3>
            <img src="images/data.jpg" alt="data visualisation">
            <p>This is the first blog post for the second semester of interactive media
                and has us examine and perform a close reading of the chapter,
                Overview of Data Visualization, the second in the text, Embodying
                Data: Chinese Aesthetics, Interactive Visualization, and Gaming
                Technologies, by author Qi Li. The following will be a summary of this
                chapter of the reading as I understood it.</p>
            <p>The text talks about the concept of data visualization, its origins, and
                where it was and is applied in ancient and modern societies. Going back
                as far as the 2nd Century, it has roots in the form olds drawings and
                manual recollections of information, through with the advent of
                computer processing and graphical software, technology has advanced
                the field data visualisation, allowing individuals to collect, analyse, and
                manipulate much larger volumes of information, and with much more
                accuracy (Li, 2020:16). Li outlines some key advantages of this practice,
                such as the ability to represent large volumes of date, indeniying
                emergent properties, understanding both alrge and small scale data,
                qaulity control, idenitifyign problems, and constructing sound
                hypothesies. </p>
            <p>This often takes the form of visual, graphical imagery, helping to make
                sound decisions from the visual representations of which Li says the
                following in relation to that: “The success of data visualization is due to
                the soundness of the basic idea behind it: using computer-generated
                images to gain insight and knowledge from data and its inherent
                patterns and relationships” (Li, 2020:18).
                </p>
            <p>Li cites several sources for what data visualization has been defined as 
                for the time it has been studied, though I have chosen to condense it 
                into the following: Data visualization is a process that involves 
                transforming data into a visual or sonic form using computer 
                technology. It involves the exchange of information between the sender, receiver, and message, utilizing visual perception abilities to 
                amplify cognition. It is a key element in identifying patterns within a 
                graphic through exploring and analyzing data. “understanding real 
                number lines, time, measurement, and estimation, as well as ratio 
                concepts like fractions, proportions, percentages, and probabilities," Li 
                writes (Li, 2020:19). She further classes this into two types: information 
                and scientific visualization, with the former representing abstract dates 
                and the latter representing physical data. Both are done via an attempt 
                at conveying graphical data into a visual form. Li goes at length 
                describing traditional means of data visualization, though I will only 
                outline them for the purposes of this text, starting with the earliest 
                mode, trees.</p>
            <p>Tree diagrams hierarchical structure provides a powerful tool for
                organizing, rationalizing, and illustrating information patterns. The
                visual metaphor of the tree is used to represent a network of nodes
                within its branches in data visualization. Some offshoots of this are
                treemap diagrams, the space-tree, and star-tree diagram, each of course
                being better suited for representing different data and information (Li,
                2020:26).
                </p>
            <p>Following that are simply maps. Maps are graphical depictions that
                highlight relationships between elements of space, such as objects or
                regions. The most conventional use is geographic maps, which are used
                to help people define, explain, and navigate through the world. For
                instance, road maps, aeronautical and nautical charts, railway or subway
                network maps, and hiking or bicycling maps Maps were designed and
                fixed on paper or durable materials. The invention of computer
                technology has allowed for the development of dynamic and interactive
                maps. interactive functions, such as zooming in and out (Li, 2020:29).</p>
            <p>Next are the charts. Useful for representing data in line, bar, or slice
                forms, charts traditionally represent data in the form of a table, graph,
                or diagram. This form is useful in representing quantitative data that
                conveys information about sizes or dimensions, and more specifically,
                in representing correlation and regression in graphic form (Li, 2020:30).</p>
            <p>Tables are another common form of visualization and do so by
                displaying data within various fields, allowing for efficient comparative data on categorical objects. Featuring rows and columns, they represent
                data in two dimensions, with quantitative data placed in the squares at
                the intersection of the row and column. Advantages of this include
                conveying precise numerical values, aiding viewers in making
                comparisons, and organizing information where graphing might not be
                appropriate. An offshoot of that are timetables, a type of table used for
                referring to and managing tools for scheduled events, tasks, actions, or
                appointments. They organize data into chronological or alphabetical
                order, allowing for quicker referencing. Timetables are basic ways to
                show arrival and departure times for transportation, making them ideal
                tools for individual time management (Li, 2020:32).
                </p>
            <p>Next are diagrams, a useful tool for business-related analysis that
                illustrates information flow through rectangles and lines. Before
                computer technology, hand-drawn graphs were used, but handling large
                amounts of data like internet data flow was not so simple. Li, 2020:32).
                Graphs, similar to diagrams, help perceive and recognize broad features
                of data or information, providing insight into the data. (Li, 2020:35).
                Some less intuitive but nonetheless useful forms are waveforms, which
                represent the shape of time related to various quantities of data;
                simulations, which enable observers to understand and describe
                sometimes unique and exotic natural phenomena; and volume
                visualization, which creates a graphical representation of data sets on
                3D grids. These are multidimensional arrays of scalar and vector data,
                typically shown on lattice structures representing values in 3D
                environments (Li, 2020:40).
                </p>
            <p>Li concludes by once again reiterating the important practice and role
                that data visualization has in society and human and technological
                interaction, with various modes of data visualization aiding in creating
                readability, recognizability, and meaning for processed information.</p>
